## Overview

### The challenge

I took the challenge to practice the basics of **_RegEX_** and the inner mechanisms for validating a form. A user should input the username, email and password correctly, there would be a tooltip for the user for further help. If the validation success, the border-color of the input field will turn to green. In oppiste, it will turn to red and show the error message.

## My Process

### Built With

- HTML5 markup
- Grid
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JS
- RegEx ðŸ”¥
- Mobile-first workflow
- [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - For font styles

### What I learned

By doing this project, I learn the basic user validation using vanilla js. I learn some tricky methods and techniques, such as, I implement a very basic **_regex_** format for username, email and password validation. I have also learn a technique for showing tooltip using pure CSS. Below I demonstrate the **_RegEx_** methods for those feature:

- For username -

```js
const isUserName = (userName) => {
  return /^[A-Za-z]\w+[A-Za-z0-9]{4,25}$/.test(userName);
};
```

For email -

```js
const isMail = (userEmail) => {
  return /^(([^<>()[\]\.,;:\s@\"]+(\.[^<>()[\]\.,;:\s@\"]+)*)|(\".+\"))@(([^<>()[\]\.,;:\s@\"]+\.)+[^<>()[\]\.,;:\s@\"]{2,})$/i.test(
    userEmail
  );
};
```

For password -

```js
const isPass = (userPass) => {
  return /^(?=.*?[A-Z])(?=.*?[a-z])(?=.*?[0-9])(?=.*?[#?!@$%^&*-]).{8,}$/.test(
    userPass
  );
};
```

### Continued Development

This challenge helps me a lot to understand the basics of Regular Expression. I build it while I conquer Wes Bos's 30 Javascript challenge. By doing this, I was able to revisit some tricky CSS methods.
